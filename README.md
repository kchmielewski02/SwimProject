# SwimProject
Regression Analysis, used to determine the correlation between a swimmers physical attributes and speed.

# Objective
My goal in this project was to determine what physical attributes made a swimmer inherently faster.  

# Action
I acomplished this by running regression analysis in R, including tests to affirm the five assumptions of linear regression. 

# Result
I found that for every 1 cm increase in height, a swimmers best time is estimated to  decrease by 0.1659 seconds. As well as,for every 1 year older a swimmer gets it is estimated their best time increases 0.16147 seconds. All in all, I found that on average taller swimmers are faster, younger swimmers are faster, and that weight has no affect on speed.
